You want to remove the 3 outliers in order to get the optimal intercept and slope.  In the case that you're sure of the existence and number (3) of outliers ahead of time, one potential brute force method to outlier detection might be to find the best Linear Regression model on all possible subsets of the training set data with 3 points removed.  Using this method, how many times will you have to calculate the Linear Regression coefficients on the training data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.4**  Construct an approximate algorithm to find a user-specified number of outlier candidates in the training data. Place your algorithm in the function `find_outliers_simple`.  It should take the parameters `dataset_x`, `dataset_y`, and `num_outliers` representing your features, response variable values (make sure your response variable is stored as a numpy column vector), and the number of outliers to remove.  Your algorithm should select the `num_outliers` most extreme residuals from the linear regression model to predict, `dataset_y` from `dataset_x`.  The return value should be a list `outlier_indices` representing the indices of the `num_outliers` outliers in the original datasets you passed in.  Apply your function to the training data in order to identify 3 outliers.  Use `statsmodels` to create a Linear Regression model on the remaining training set data (with the 3 outliers removed), and store your model in the variable `OutlierFreeSimpleModel`.\n",

The second plot should include a scatterplot of points from the test set with the same two regression lines fitted on the training set: with and without outliers.  Visually which model fits the test set data more closely?\n",

One potential problem with the brute force outlier detection approach in 4.3 and the heuristic algorithm you constructed 4.4 is that they assume prior knowledge of the number of outliers.  In general you can't expect to know ahead of time the number of outliers in your dataset.  Propose how you would alter and/or use the algorithm you constructed in 4.4 to create a more general heuristic (i.e. one which doesn't presuppose the number of outliers) for finding outliers in your dataset.  \n",
