    "##Web Scraping\n",
    "- See HW1 beautiful soup for how to do it\n",
    "- ethical implications of web scraping: be aware of accuracy and source of data you're scraping, are you violating terms of service?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Types of data\n",
    "- simple = 1 piece of information\n",
    "- atomic = many\n",
    "- numeric, boolean, strings: always have to ask yourself what kind of data you're recording\n",
    "- categorical vs numerical data\n",
    "- for numerical: discrete vs continuous data type\n",
    "    \n",
    "##Data Storgae\n",
    "- typically tabular with columns representing the type of data (attribute, features) and rows the specific observations (record)\n",
    "\n",
    "##Example of Hubway\n",
    "- each row has a unique id\n",
    "- data organized by increasing date vertically\n",
    "- trip data on the left and customer data on the right. Note: multiple trips per customer possible\n",
    "    \n",
    "##Common issues with data\n",
    "- missing values: how to fill in? filter vs dropping rows (biases) vs dropping column (consider looking into why this column was so empty)\n",
    "- wrong values: how can we detect and correct? \n",
    "- Messy format\n",
    "- data may not be usable\n",
    "\n",
    "#Messy Data \n",
    "- not tabular format > need to put it into tabular format first\n",
    "- three variables are: day, time of day and number of deliveries\n",
    "- 9 observations total = rows\n",
    "\n",
    "##Basics of sampling\n",
    "- Collect data. Biases in samples:\n",
    "    - selection bias\n",
    "    - nonresponse bias\n",
    "- Can calculate:\n",
    "    - Sample mean: center of the distribution of the data. There is always uncertainty.\n",
    "    - Sample median: mean is severily affected by outliers, the median is not. Think about which one makes more sense to use given your research question e.g. avg salary of Harvard class that incl. Bill gates > median better\n",
    "    - skeweness\n",
    "    \n",
    "##Computational times\n",
    "- mean: O(n)\n",
    "- median: at most O(n) or O(nlogn)\n",
    "- range: max - min\n",
    "- variance: how much on avg the sample values deviate from the mean\n",
    "- std deviation is in the same units as the initial data set which is why we use it instead of variance\n",
    "    \n",
    "##Categorical variables\n",
    "- mean and median make no sense. Modes make more sense\n",
    "\n",
    "##DATA EXPLORATION: VISUALIZATION\n",
    "- Anscombe's data: summary statistics don't tell the whole picture\n",
    "- show: dist, relationsip, compostion, comparison\n",
    "- hist: viz how 1-dimensional data is dist across certain values. Want the right level of granularity to get enough info but not too much\n",
    "    - multiple histograms on the same plot to compare how different sub-groups compare in terms of distribution\n",
    "- pie chart: frowned upon b/c humans better at comparing lengths than angles\n",
    "- scatter plot: way to viz relationship between multi variables.\n",
    "- stacked area graph: viz the composition of group as it changes over time\n",
    "- boxplot: compare quant variable across several groups (simplified)\n",
