1. The boundary tips towards vertical
2. The boundary is in the same place as it was originally, but is squished together. The model is much more certain about how to predict points a given distance from the boundary
3. It shifts the boundary, perpendicular to its current orientation
4. Including squared terms allows quadratic decision boundaries, and the interraction term allows hyperbolic boundaries
