# General

-  **Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner?**
  - Individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner.  You are allowed to use OHs to ask questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with all of your coding.  You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation.
- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student?**
  - Yes. All CS109A students have access to all video captured materials. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID.
- **Can I access live streaming?**
  - Only Harvard Extension School students have access to live-streaming of CS109A lectures, labs, and sections. However, our Friday Standard Section will be live-streamed to all the students that wish to participate in the Helix classroom, so you can attend in person or live online.
- **Can I make-up quizzes?**
  - No.  Only 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade.  This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade.

# Auditors

- **Can I audit this course? What can I and cannot do?**
  - Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture, sections and lab. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects, and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed.

# Extension School

- **I am an Extension School Student, can I take the quizzes? And do they count towards my grade?**
  - All CS109A students have access to quizzes. If you are a Harvard Extension School student, the quizzes will not be considered towards your final grade.
- **I am an Extension School student, can I attend lectures and OH in person?**
  - Yes, as a student from a Harvard School you are welcome to attend all learning instances (lecture, OH, Sections, and Labs) in person. Given the distance nature of the student body of Harvard Extension School, we also provide live streaming and video capture of our learning instances.
