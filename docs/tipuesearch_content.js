Individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner. You are allowed to use OHs to ask questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with all of your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation. Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student? Yes. All CS109A students have access to all video captured materials. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID. Can I access live streaming? Only Harvard Extension School students have access to live-streaming of CS109A lectures, labs, and sections. However, our Friday Standard Section will be live-streamed to all the students that wish to participate in the Helix classroom, so you can attend in person or live online. Can I make-up quizzes? No. Only 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade. Auditors Can I audit this course? What can I and cannot do? Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture, sections and lab. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects, and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed. Extension School I am an Extension School Student, can I take the quizzes? And do they count towards my grade? All CS109A students have access to quizzes. If you are a Harvard Extension School student, the quizzes will not be considered towards your final grade. I am an Extension School student, can I attend lectures and OH in person? Yes, as a student from a Harvard School you are welcome to attend all learning instances (lecture, OH, Sections, and Labs) in person. Given the distance nature of the student body of Harvard Extension School, we also provide live streaming and video capture of our learning instances.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/faq.html"},{"title":"Videos","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } Lecture recordings can be viewed here","tags":"pages","url":"pages/videos.html"},{"title":"Projects","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } More material coming soon!","tags":"pages","url":"pages/projects.html"},{"title":"Resources","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } GitHub Repo Online OH Zoom Link Ed Setting up Anaconda & Git for Windows Forking a Repo","tags":"pages","url":"pages/resources.html"},{"title":"Schedule","text":"Week Lecture (Mon) Lecture (Wed) Lab (Thu) Advanced Section (Wed) Assignment (R:Released Tue - D:Due Wed) 1.00 Lecture 1: What is Data Science?

This course is the first half of a one‐year introduction to data science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. The material of the course is divided into 3 modules. Each module will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: 1. data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; 2. data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably; 3. exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; 4. prediction or statistical learning; and 5. communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit. Course Logistics Prerequisites You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended). HW0 is designed to test your knowledge on the prerequisites. Successful completion of this assignment will show that this course is suitable for you. HW0 will not be graded but you are required to submit. Course Components Lectures The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Mon and Wed 1:30pm ‐ 2:45 pm in Northwest Building (NW), Lecture Hall B-103. Attendance to lectures is mandatory for FAS students. We will have in class quizzes to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Labs Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities. The instructor will go over practice problems similar to the homework problems and review difficult material. Attendance to labs is optional but strongly encouraged . Lab sessions are held Thur 4:30-5:45 pm in Pierce 301 . Sections Lectures and labs are supplemented by 1 hour sections led by teaching fellows. There are two types of sections: a) Standard Sections : which will be a mix of review of material and practice problems similar to the HW Standard Sections are held Fri 10:30-11:45 am at 1 Story St. Room 306 and Mon 4:30-5:45 pm in Science Center 110 Note: Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. The material covered on Friday and Monday is identical. b) Advanced Sections which will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the Advanced Sections is required for all AC 209A students. Advanced Sections are held Weds 4-5:15 pm at 1 Story St. Room 306 Note: Advanced Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. Video Recordings All learning instances—lectures, labs, and sections—will be recorded. DCE students can stream these events in real time with a TF monitoring the accompanying chat room. Recordings will then be made available to all students within 24 hours via Canvas. Instructor Office Hours Pavlos & Kevin : Monday 3-5pm, IACS lobby Chris : Wednesday 3-4pm, Maxwell-Dworkin B125 Assignments There will be an initial self-assessment homework called HW0 and 8 more graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due in a week and some of them in two weeks. You have the option to work and submit in pairs for all the assignments except two which you will do individually. You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own environment or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud ( details on this to come ). On weeks with new assignments they will be released by Wednesday 1:30 pm. Standard assignments are graded out of 5 points. AC209a students will have additional homework content for most assignments worth 1 point. Quizzes Quizzes will be taken at the end of class and the material will be based on what was discussed in lecture; there will be no AC209a content in the quizzes. DCE students' quizzes will not count toward their final grade. 50% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. Final Project There will be a final group project (2-4 students) due during Exams period. See Calendar for specific dates. Participation Students as expected to be actively engaged with the course. This includes: attending lectures making use of resources such as office hours, labs, and sections participating in the Ed discussion forum — both through asking thoughtful questions and by answering the questions of others DCE students will not be penalized for the inability to attend lectures, labs, etc. live. Recommended Textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani. The book is available here: Free electronic version : http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ (Links to an external site).

Course Policies Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, JupyterHub, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: 1. Post the question in Ed and hopefully your peers will answer. Note that in Ed questions are visible to everyone. The TFs monitor the posts. 2. Go to Office Hours , this is the best way to get help. 3. For private matters send an email to the Helpline: cs109a2019@gmail.com . The Helpline is monitored by TFs. 4. For personal and confidential matters send an email to the instructors . Grading Guidelines and Regrading Policy Homework will be graded based on: 1. How correct your code is (the Notebook cells should run, we are not troubleshooting code) 2. How you have interpreted the results — we want text not just code. It should be a report. 3. How well you present the results. The scale is 1-5. For more details, check out The CS109A Grade . Questions on Graded Homework and Regrading Policy We take great care in making sure all homework assignments are graded properly. However, if you feel that your assignment was not fairly graded you may: Contact the grader by emailing the helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" within 48 hours of the grade release . If still unhappy with the initial response, then submit a reason via email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Second request\" within 2 days of receiving the initial response. Note: once regrading is done, you may receive a grade that is higher or lower than the initial grade. Collaboration Policy We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students (and on Piazza), but you are not allowed to look at any other student's assignment or code outside of your pair. Discussion is encouraged; copying is not allowed. Please refer to the Academic Honesty section in The CS109A Grade https://canvas.harvard.edu/files/8463173/download?download_frd=1. Late Day Policy Homework is due on Wednesdays. There are no late days. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Canvas . All homework and quizzes will be posted and submitted through Canvas, as well as all feedback forms. NOTE: make sure you adjust your account settings so you can receive emails from Canvas. Submitting an assignment Instructions for turning in assignments will be posted when the semester starts. Course Grade Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Non-Extension Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Homework0 1% Paired Homework (6) 39% Individual Homework (2) 17 % Quizzes 10% Project 30% Participation 3% Total 100% Extension Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Homework0 1% Paired Homework (6) 43% Individual Homework (2) 19% Project 33% Participation 4% Total 100% Software We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, Python 3, and various python modules. You can access the notebook viewer either on your own machine by installing the Anaconda platform (Links to an external site) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: Made /w Code . We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.) As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates. Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets and allow submission in pairs for most problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Academic Honesty section in The CS109A Grade .","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"S-Section 01: Introduction to Web Scraping","text":"/*! * * IPython notebook * */ /* CSS font colors for translated ANSI colors. */ .ansibold { font-weight: bold; } /* use dark versions for foreground, to improve visibility */ .ansiblack { color: black; } .ansired { color: darkred; } .ansigreen { color: darkgreen; } .ansiyellow { color: #c4a000; } .ansiblue { color: darkblue; } .ansipurple { color: darkviolet; } .ansicyan { color: steelblue; } .ansigray { color: gray; } /* and light for background, for the same reason */ .ansibgblack { background-color: black; } .ansibgred { background-color: red; } .ansibggreen { background-color: green; } .ansibgyellow { background-color: yellow; } .ansibgblue { background-color: blue; } .ansibgpurple { background-color: magenta; } .ansibgcyan { background-color: cyan; } .ansibggray { background-color: gray; } div.cell { /* Old browsers */ display: -webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-align: stretch; display: -moz-box; -moz-box-orient: vertical; -moz-box-align: stretch; display: box; box-orient: vertical; box-align: stretch; /* Modern browsers */ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch; border-radius: 2px; box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; width: 100%; padding: 5px; /* This acts as a spacer between cells, that is outside the border */ margin: 0px; outline: none; border-left-width: 1px; padding-left: 5px; background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent -40px, transparent 1px, transparent 1px, transparent 100%); } div.cell.jupyter-soft-selected { border-left-color: #90CAF9; border-left-color: #E3F2FD; border-left-width: 1px; padding-left: 5px; border-right-color: #E3F2FD; border-right-width: 1px; background: #E3F2FD; } @media print { div.cell.jupyter-soft-selected { border-color: transparent; } } div.cell.selected { border-color: #ababab; border-left-width: 0px; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #42A5F5 -40px, #42A5F5 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 100%); } @media print { div.cell.selected { border-color: transparent; } } div.cell.selected.jupyter-soft-selected { border-left-width: 0; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #42A5F5 -40px, #42A5F5 7px, #E3F2FD 7px, #E3F2FD 100%); } .edit_mode div.cell.selected { border-color: #66BB6A; border-left-width: 0px; padding-left: 6px; background: linear-gradient(to right, #66BB6A -40px, #66BB6A 5px, transparent 5px, transparent 100%); } @media print { .edit_mode div.cell.selected { border-color: transparent; } } .prompt { /* This needs to be wide enough for 3 digit prompt numbers: In[100]: */ min-width: 14ex; /* This padding is tuned to match the padding on the CodeMirror editor. */ padding: 0.4em; margin: 0px; font-family: monospace; text-align: right; /* This has to match that of the the CodeMirror class line-height below */ line-height: 1.21429em; /* Don't highlight prompt number selection */ -webkit-touch-callout: none; -webkit-user-select: none; -khtml-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; user-select: none; /* Use default cursor */ cursor: default; } @media (max-width: 540px) { .prompt { text-align: left; } } div.inner_cell { min-width: 0; /* Old browsers */ display: -webkit-box; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; -webkit-box-align: stretch; display: -moz-box; -moz-box-orient: vertical; -moz-box-align: stretch; display: box; box-orient: vertical; box-align: stretch; /* Modern browsers */ display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: stretch; /* Old browsers */ -webkit-box-flex: 1; -moz-box-flex: 1; box-flex: 1; /* Modern browsers */ flex: 1; } /* input_area and input_prompt must match in top border and margin for alignment */ div.input_area { border: 1px solid #cfcfcf; border-radius: 2px; background: #f7f7f7; line-height: 1.21429em; } /* This is needed so that empty prompt areas can collapse to zero height when there is no content in the output_subarea and the prompt.

Specifically, our learning objectives are: Understand the structure of an HTML document and use that structure to extract desired information Use Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and Pandas DataFrames to store and manipulate information Identify some other (semi-)structured formats commonly used for storing and transferring data, such as JSON and CSV Practice using Python packages such as BeautifulSoup and Pandas , including how to navigate their documentation to find functionality. In [ ]: % matplotlib inline import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns sns . set_style ( \"whitegrid\" ) sns . set_context ( \"notebook\" ) import json import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from IPython.display import HTML In [ ]: # Setting up 'requests' to make HTTPS requests properly takes some extra steps... we'll skip them for now. requests . packages . urllib3 . disable_warnings () import warnings warnings . filterwarnings ( \"ignore\" ) Goals Is science becoming more collaborative over time? How about literature? Are there a few \"geniuses\" or lots of hard workers? One way we might answer those questions is by looking at Nobel Prizes. We could ask questions like: Has anyone won a prize more than once? How has the total number of recipients changed over time? How has the number of recipients per award changed over time? To answer these questions, we'll need data: who received what award when . Before we dive into acquiring this data the way we've been teaching in class, let's pause to ask: what are 5 different approaches we could take to acquiring Nobel Prize data ? When possible: find a structured dataset (.csv,.json,.xls) After a google search we stumble upon this dataset on github . It is also in the section folder named github-nobel-prize-winners.csv . We use pandas to read it: In [ ]: df = pd . read_csv ( \"../data/github-nobel-prize-winners.csv\" ) df . head () Or you may want to read an xlsx file: (Potential missing package; you might need to run the following command in your terminal first: !conda install xlrd ) In [ ]: df = pd . read_excel ( \"../data/github-nobel-prize-winners.xlsx\" ) df . head () QUIZ: Did anyone recieve the Nobel Prize more than once? How would you check if anyone recieved more than one nobel prize? In [ ]: # list storing all the names name_winners = [] for name in df . winner : # Check if we already encountered this name: if name in name_winners : # if so, print the name print ( name ) else : # otherwhise the name to the list name_winners . append ( name ) We don't want to print \"No Prize was Awarded\" all the time. In [ ]: # Your code here How can we make this into a oneligner? In [ ]: winners = [] [ print ( name ) if ( name in winners and name != \"No Prize was Awarded\" ) else winners . append ( name ) for name in df . winner ]; Otherwhise: WEB SCRAPING Turns out that https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/ has the data we want. Let's take a look at the website and to look at the underhood HTML: right-click and click on inspect . Try to find structure in the tree-structured HTML. But the nobelprize.org server is a little slow sometimes. Fortunately, the Internet Archive periodically crawls most of the Internet and saves what it finds. (That's a lot of data!) So let's grab the data from the Archive's \"Wayback Machine\" (great name!). We'll just give you the direct URL, but at the very end you'll see how we can get it out of a JSON response from the Wayback Machine API. In [ ]: snapshot_url = 'http://web.archive.org/web/20180820111639/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/' In [ ]: snapshot = requests . get ( snapshot_url ) snapshot What is a this Response [200]? Let's google: response 200 meaning . All possible codes here . In [ ]: type ( snapshot ) Try to request \"www.xoogle.be\"? What happens? In [ ]: snapshot_url2 = 'http://web.archive.org/web/20180820111639/https://www.xoogle.be' snapshot = requests . get ( snapshot_url2 ) snapshot Always remember to \"not to be evil\" when scraping with requests! If downloading multiple pages (like you will be on HW1), always put a delay between requests (e.g, time.sleep(1) , with the time library) so you don't unwittingly hammer someone's webserver and/or get blocked. In [ ]: snapshot = requests . get ( snapshot_url ) raw_html = snapshot . text print ( raw_html [: 500 ]) Regular Expressions You can find specific patterns or strings in text by using Regular Expressions: This is a pattern matching mechanism used throughout Computer Science and programming (it's not just specific to Python). Some great resources that we recommend, if you are interested in them (could be very useful for a homework problem): https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/re.html https://regexone.com https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html . Specify a specific sequence with the help of regex special characters. Some examples: \\S : Matches any character which is not a Unicode whitespace character \\d : Matches any Unicode decimal digit * : Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. Let's find all the occurances of 'Marie' in our raw_html: In [ ]: import re In [ ]: re . findall ( r 'Marie' , raw_html ) Using \\S to match 'Marie' + ' ' + 'any character which is not a Unicode whitespace character': In [ ]: re . findall ( r 'Marie \\S' , raw_html ) How would we find their lastnames that comes after Marie? In [ ]: # Your code here Now, we have all our data in the notebook. Unfortunately, it is the form of one really long string, which is hard to work with directly. This is where BeautifulSoup comes in. Parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup In [ ]: soup = BeautifulSoup ( raw_html , 'html.parser' ) Key BeautifulSoup functions we'll be using in this section: tag.prettify() : Returns cleaned-up version of raw HTML, useful for printing tag.select(selector) : Return a list of nodes matching a CSS selector tag.select_one(selector) : Return the first node matching a CSS selector tag.text/soup.get_text() : Returns visible text of a node (e.g.,\" Some text \" -> \"Some text\") tag.contents : A list of the immediate children of this node You can also use these functions to find nodes. tag.find_all(tag_name, attrs=attributes_dict) : Returns a list of matching nodes tag.find(tag_name, attrs=attributes_dict) : Returns first matching node BeautifulSoup is a very powerful library -- much more info here: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ Let's practice some BeautifulSoup commands... Print a cleaned-up version of the raw HTML In [ ]: # Your code here Find the first \"title\" object In [ ]: # Your code here Extract the text of first \"title\" object In [ ]: # Your code here Extracting award data Let's use the structure of the HTML document to extract the data we want. From inspecting the page in DevTools, we found that each award is in a div with a by_year class. Let's get all of them. In [ ]: award_nodes = soup . select ( '.by_year' ) len ( award_nodes ) Let's pull out an example. In [ ]: award_node = award_nodes [ 200 ] In [ ]: HTML ( award_node . prettify ()) Let's practice getting data out of a BS Node The prize title In [ ]: award_node . select_one ( 'h3' ) . text How do we separate the title from the year? In [ ]: # Your code here How do we separate the year from the year? In [ ]: # Your code here Let's put them into functions: In [ ]: def get_award_title ( award_node ): return award_node . select_one ( 'h3' ) . text [: - 4 ] . strip () In [ ]: def get_award_year ( award_node ): return int ( award_node . select_one ( 'h3' ) . text [ - 4 :]) Make a list of titles for all awards In [ ]: list_awards = [] for award_node in award_nodes : list_awards . append ( get_award_title ( award_node )) list_awards Let's use list comprehension: In [ ]: # Your code here The recipients How do we handle there being more than one? In [ ]: [ node . text for node in award_node . select ( 'h6 a' )] We'll leave them as a list for now, to return to this later. The prize \"motivation\" How would you get the 'motivation'/reason of the prize from the following award_node ? In [ ]: award_node = award_nodes [ 200 ] award_node In [ ]: # Your code here Putting everything into functions: In [ ]: def get_award_motivation ( award_node ): award_node = award_node . select_one ( 'p' ) if not award_node : return None return award_node . text #.lstrip('\\u201c').rstrip('\\u201d') In [ ]: def get_recipients ( award_node ): return [ node . text for node in award_node . select ( 'h6 a' )] Let's create a Pandas dataframe Now let's get all of the awards. In [ ]: awards = [] for award_node in soup . select ( '.by_year' ): recipients = get_recipients ( award_node ) award = {} award [ 'title' ] = get_award_title ( award_node ) award [ 'year' ] = get_award_year ( award_node ) award [ 'recipients' ] = recipients award [ 'num_recipients' ] = len ( recipients ) award [ 'motivation' ] = get_award_motivation ( award_node ) awards . append ( award ) In [ ]: df_awards_raw = pd . DataFrame ( awards ) In [ ]: df_awards_raw Some quick EDA. In [ ]: df_awards_raw . info () In [ ]: df_awards_raw . year . min () Hm, that's suspiciously close to a round number. Are we missing some? How about recipients? In [ ]: df_awards_raw . head () In [ ]: df_awards_raw . num_recipients . value_counts () Why do some have no recipients? In [ ]: df_awards_raw [ df_awards_raw . num_recipients == 0 ] Ok: 2018 awards have no recipients because this is a 2018 archived version of nobel prize webpage. Some past years lack awards because there actually were none that year. Let's keep only meaningful data: In [ ]: df_awards_past = df_awards_raw [ df_awards_raw . year != 2018 ] df_awards_past . info () Hm, motivation has a different number of items... why? In [ ]: df_awards_past [ df_awards_past . motivation . isnull ()] Looks like it's fine that those motivations were missing. Sort the awards by year. In [ ]: df_awards_past . sort_values ( 'year' ) . head () How many awards of each type were given? In [ ]: df_awards_past . title . value_counts () But wait, that includes the years the awards weren't offered. In [ ]: df_awards_actually_offered = df_awards_past [ df_awards_past . num_recipients > 0 ] df_awards_actually_offered . title . value_counts () When was each award first given? In [ ]: df_awards_actually_offered . groupby ( 'title' ) . year . describe () How many recipients per year? Let's include the years with missing awards; if we were to analyze further, we'd have to decide whether to include them. In [ ]: df_awards_past . plot . scatter ( x = 'year' , y = 'num_recipients' ); It's hard to see a trend when there are multiple observations per year ( why? ). Let's try looking at total num recipients by year. In [ ]: plt . figure ( figsize = [ 16 , 6 ]) # plt.plot(df_awards_past.groupby('year').num_recipients.sum(), color = 'b', linewidth='2') plt . plot ( df_awards_past . groupby ( 'year' ) . num_recipients . sum (), '-ob' , linewidth = '2' , alpha = 0.75 ) plt . title ( 'Total Nobel Awards per year' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Year' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Number of recipients' ) plt . grid ( 'on' ) plt . show (); Check out the years 1940-43? Any comment? Any trends the last 25 years? In [ ]: plt . figure ( figsize = [ 16 , 6 ]) i = 0 for award in set ( df_awards_past . title ): i += 1 year = df_awards_past [ df_awards_past [ 'title' ] == award ] . year recips = df_awards_past [ df_awards_past [ 'title' ] == award ] . num_recipients index = year > 2019 - 25 years_filtered = year [ index ] . values recips_filtered = recips [ index ] . values plt . subplot ( 2 , 3 , i ) plt . bar ( years_filtered , recips_filtered , color = 'b' , alpha = 0.7 ) plt . title ( award ) plt . xlabel ( 'Year' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Number of Recipients' ) plt . ylim ( 0 , 3 ) plt . tight_layout () End of Standard Section Extra: Did anyone recieve the Nobel Prize more than once (based upon scraped data)? Here's where it bites us that our original DataFrame isn't \"tidy\". Let's make a tidy one. In [ ]: tidy_awards = [] for idx , row in df_awards_past . iterrows (): for recipient in row [ 'recipients' ]: tidy_awards . append ( dict ( recipient = recipient , year = row [ 'year' ])) tidy_awards_df = pd . DataFrame ( tidy_awards ) tidy_awards_df . info () Now we can look at each recipient individually. In [ ]: tidy_awards_df . recipient . value_counts () Extra: Other structured data formats: JSON and CSV CSV CSV is a lowest-common-denominator format for tabular data. In [ ]: df_awards_past . to_csv ( '../data/awards.csv' , index = False ) with open ( '../data/awards.csv' , 'r' ) as f : print ( f . read ()[: 1000 ]) It loses some info, though: the recipients list became a plain string, and the reader needs to guess whether each column is numeric or not. In [ ]: pd . read_csv ( '../data/awards.csv' ) . recipients . iloc [ 20 ] JSON JSON preserves structured data, but fewer data-science tools speak it. In [ ]: df_awards_past . to_json ( '../data/awards.json' , orient = 'records' ) with open ( '../data/awards.json' , 'r' ) as f : print ( f . read ()[: 1000 ]) Lists and other basic data types are preserved. (Custom data types aren't preserved, but you'll get an error when saving.) In [ ]: pd . read_json ( '../data/awards.json' ) . recipients . iloc [ 20 ] Extra: Pickle: handy for storing data For temporary data storage in a single version of Python, pickle s will preserve your data even more faithfully, even many custom data types. But don't count on it for exchanging data or long-term storage. (In fact, don't try to load untrusted pickle s -- they can run arbitrary code!) In [ ]: df_awards_past . to_pickle ( '../data/awards.pkl' ) with open ( '../data/awards.pkl' , 'r' , encoding = 'latin1' ) as f : print ( f . read ()[: 200 ]) Yup, lots of internal Python and Pandas stuff... In [ ]: pd . read_pickle ( '../data/awards.pkl' ) . recipients . iloc [ 20 ] Extra: Formatted data output Let's make a textual table of Physics laureates by year, earliest first: In [ ]: for idx , row in df_awards_past . sort_values ( 'year' ) . iterrows (): if 'Physics' in row [ 'title' ]: print ( ' {} : {} ' . format ( row [ 'year' ], ', ' . join ( row [ 'recipients' ]))) Extra: Parsing JSON to get the Wayback Machine URL We could go to http://archive.org , search for our URL, and get the URL for the archived version there. But since you'll often need to talk with APIs, let's take this opportunity to use the Wayback Machine's API . This will also give us a chance to practice working with JSON. In [ ]: url = \"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes/\" # All 3 of these do the same thing. The third is my (KCA's) favorite new feature of Python 3.6. wayback_query_url = 'http://archive.org/wayback/available?url= {} ' . format ( url ) wayback_query_url = 'http://archive.org/wayback/available?url= {url} ' . format ( url = url ) wayback_query_url = f 'http://archive.org/wayback/available?url= {url} ' r = requests . get ( wayback_query_url ) We got some kind of response... what is it? In [ ]: r . text Yay, JSON ! It's usually pretty easy to work with JSON, once we parse it. In [ ]: json . loads ( r . text ) Loading responses as JSON is so common that requests has a convenience method for it: In [ ]: response_json = r . json () response_json What kind of object is this? A little Python syntax review: How can we get the snapshot URL? In [ ]: snapshot_url = response_json [ 'archived_snapshots' ][ 'closest' ][ 'url' ] snapshot_url if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var mathjaxscript = document.createElement('script'); mathjaxscript.id = 'mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#'; mathjaxscript.type = 'text/javascript'; mathjaxscript.src = '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'; mathjaxscript[(window.opera ? \"innerHTML\" : \"text\")] = \"MathJax.Hub.Config({\" + \" config: ['MMLorHTML.js'],\" + \" TeX: { extensions: ['AMSmath.js','AMSsymbols.js','noErrors.js','noUndefined.js'], equationNumbers: { autoNumber: 'AMS' } },\" + \" jax: ['input/TeX','input/MathML','output/HTML-CSS'],\" + \" extensions: ['tex2jax.js','mml2jax.js','MathMenu.js','MathZoom.js'],\" + \" displayAlign: 'center',\" + \" displayIndent: '0em',\" + \" showMathMenu: true,\" + \" tex2jax: { \" + \" inlineMath: [ ['$','$'] ], \" + \" displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'] ],\" + \" processEscapes: true,\" + \" preview: 'TeX',\" + \" }, \" + \" 'HTML-CSS': { \" + \" linebreaks: { automatic: true, width: '95% container' }, \" + \" styles: { '.MathJax_Display, .MathJax .mo, .MathJax .mi, .MathJax .mn': {color: 'black !

Programming at the level of CS 50 is a prerequisite for this course. If you have concerns about this, come speak with any of the instructors. We will refer to the Python 3 documentation in this lab and throughout the course. Learning Goals This introductory lab is a condensed introduction to Python numerical programming. By the end of this lab, you will feel more comfortable: Learn about anconda environments and setup your own with the necessary dependencies Writing short Python code using functions, loops, lists, numpy arrays, and dictionaries. Manipulating Python lists and numpy arrays and understanding the difference between them. Introducing the stats libraries scipy.stats and statsmodels Part 1: Set up a Conda Python Environment and Clone the Class Repository On Python installation packages There are two main installing packages for Python, conda and pip . Pip is the Python Packaging Authority's recommended tool for installing packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) . Conda is a cross platform package and environment manager that installs and manages conda packages from the Anaconda repository and Anaconda Cloud . Conda does not assume any specific configuration in your computer and will install the Python interpreter along with the other Python packages, whereas pip assumes that you have installed the Python interpreter in your computer. Given the fact that most operating systems do include Python this is not a problem. If I could summarize their differences into a sentence it would be that conda has the ability to create isolated environments that can contain different versions of Python and/or the packages installed in them. This can be extremely useful when working with data science tools as different tools may contain conflicting requirements which could prevent them all being installed into a single environment. You can have environments with pip but would have to install a tool such as virtualenv or venv. You may use either, we recommend conda because in our experience it leads to fewer incompatibilities between packages and thus fewer broken environments. Conclusion: Use Both. Most often in our data science environments we want to combining pip with conda when one or more packages are only available to install via pip. Although thousands of packages are available in the Anaconda repository, including the most popular data science, machine learning, and AI frameworks but a lot more are available on PyPI. Even if you have your environment installed via conda you can use pip to install individual packages ( source: anaconda site ) Installing Conda - First check if you have conda In MacOS or Linux open a Terminal window and at the prompt type conda –V If you get the version number (e.g. conda 4.6.14 ) you are all set! If you get an error, that means you do not have Anaconda and would be a good idea to install it. - If you do not have it, you can install it by following the instructions: Mac : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/ Windows : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows (Note: #8 is important: DO NOT add to your path. The reason is that Windows contains paths that may include spaces and that clashes with the way conda understands paths.) - If you do have anaconda consider upgrading it so you get the latest version of the packages: conda update conda Conda allows you to work in 'computing sandboxes' called environments. You may have environments installed on your computer to access different versions of Python and different libraries to avoid conflict between libraries which can cause errors. NOTE (Sept.6, 2019): If you are still having issues please check the Announcements and the Discussion Forum (Ed) via the 2019-CS109a Canvas site Also please check the latest version of the cs109a.yml file. We have edited it as of today. What are environments and do I need them? Environments in Python are like sandboxes that have different versions of Python and/or packages installed in them. You can create, export, list, remove, and update environments. Switching or moving between environments is called activating the environment. When you are done with an environments you may deactivate it. For this class we want to have a bit more control on the packages that will be installed with the enviromnent so we will create an environment with a so called YAML file called cs109a.yml . Originally YAML was said to mean Yet Another Markup Language referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it was then repurposed as YAML Ain't Markup Language [source:wikipedia]. This is included in the Lab directory in the class git repository. Creating an environment from an environment.yml file Using your browser, visit the class git repository https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2019-CS109A Go to content --> labs/ --> lab1 and look for the cs109a.yml file. Download it to a local directory in your computer. Then in the Terminal again type conda env create -f {PATH-TO-FILE}/cs109a.yml Activate the new environment: source activate cs109a You should see the name of the environment at the start of your command prompth in parenthesis. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly: conda list This will give you a list of the packages installed in this environment. References Manage conda environments Clone the class repository In the Terminal type: git clone https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2019-CS109A.git Starting the Jupyter Notebook Once all is installed go in the Terminal and type jupyter notebook to start the jupyter notebook server. This will spawn a process that will be running in the Terminal window until you are done working with the notebook. In that case press control-C to stop it. Starting the notebook will bring up a browser window with your file structure. Look for the 2019-CS109A folder. It should be where you cloned it previously. When you visit this folder in the future, and while in the top folder of it, type git pull This will update the contents of the folder with whatever is new. Make sure you are at the top part of the folder by typing pwd which should give you /2019-CS109A/ For more on using the Notebook see : https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Part 2: Getting Started with Python Importing modules All notebooks should begin with code that imports modules , collections of built-in, commonly-used Python functions. Below we import the Numpy module, a fast numerical programming library for scientific computing. Future labs will require additional modules, which we'll import with the same syntax. import MODULE_NAME as MODULE_NICKNAME In [3]: import numpy as np #imports a fast numerical programming library Now that Numpy has been imported, we can access some useful functions. For example, we can use mean to calculate the mean of a set of numbers. In [4]: my_list = [ 1.2 , 2 , 3.3 ] np . mean ( my_list ) Out[4]: 2.1666666666666665 Calculations and variables In [5]: # // is integer division 1 / 2 , 1 // 2 , 1.0 / 2 , 3 * 3.2 Out[5]: (0, 0, 0.5, 9.600000000000001) The last line in a cell is returned as the output value, as above. For cells with multiple lines of results, we can display results using print , as can be seen below. In [6]: print ( 1 + 3.0 , \" \\n \" , 9 , 7 ) 5 / 3 (4.0, '\\n', 9, 7) Out[6]: 1 We can store integer or floating point values as variables. The other basic Python data types -- booleans, strings, lists -- can also be stored as variables. In [7]: a = 1 b = 2.0 Here is the storing of a list In [1]: a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Think of a variable as a label for a value, not a box in which you put the value (image: Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho) In [2]: b = a b Out[2]: [1, 2, 3] This DOES NOT create a new copy of a . It merely puts a new label on the memory at a, as can be seen by the following code: In [3]: print ( \"a\" , a ) print ( \"b\" , b ) a [ 1 ] = 7 print ( \"a after change\" , a ) print ( \"b after change\" , b ) a [1, 2, 3] b [1, 2, 3] a after change [1, 7, 3] b after change [1, 7, 3] Tuples Multiple items on one line in the interface are returned as a tuple , an immutable sequence of Python objects. See the end of this notebook for an interesting use of tuples . In [10]: a = 1 b = 2.0 a + a , a - b , b * b , 10 * a Out[10]: (2, -1.0, 4.0, 10) type() We can obtain the type of a variable, and use boolean comparisons to test these types. VERY USEFUL when things go wrong and you cannot understand why this method does not work on a specific variable! In [11]: type ( a ) == float Out[11]: False In [12]: type ( a ) == int Out[12]: True In [13]: type ( a ) Out[13]: int For reference, below are common arithmetic and comparison operations. EXERCISE 1: Create a tuple called `tup` with the following seven objects: The first element is an integer of your choice The second element is a float of your choice The third element is the sum of the first two elements The fourth element is the difference of the first two elements The fifth element is the first element divided by the second element Display the output of tup . What is the type of the variable tup ? What happens if you try and chage an item in the tuple? In [6]: # your code here tup = ( 1 , 1.1 , 1 + 1.1 , 1 - 1.1 , 1 / 1.1 ) print ( tup ) print ( type ( tup )) (1, 1.1, 2.1, -0.10000000000000009, 0.9090909090909091) In [73]: # TO RUN THE SOLUTIONS # 1. uncomment the first line of the cell below so you have just %load # 2. Run the cell AGAIN to execute the python code, it will not run when you execute the %load command!! In [8]: # %load ../solutions/exercise1.py a = 3 b = 4.0 c = a + b d = a - b e = a / b tup = ( a , b , c , d , e ) tup Out[8]: (3, 4.0, 7.0, -1.0, 0.75) Lists Much of Python is based on the notion of a list. In Python, a list is a sequence of items separated by commas, all within square brackets. The items can be integers, floating points, or another type. Unlike in C arrays, items in a Python list can be different types, so Python lists are more versatile than traditional arrays in C or other languages. Let's start out by creating a few lists. In [16]: empty_list = [] float_list = [ 1. , 3. , 5. , 4. , 2. ] int_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] mixed_list = [ 1 , 2. , 3 , 4. , 5 ] print ( empty_list ) print ( int_list ) print ( mixed_list , float_list ) [] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] ([1, 2.0, 3, 4.0, 5], [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0]) Lists in Python are zero-indexed, as in C. The first entry of the list has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. In [17]: print ( int_list [ 0 ]) print ( float_list [ 1 ]) 1 3.0 What happens if we try to use an index that doesn't exist for that list? Python will complain! In [18]: print ( float_list [ 10 ]) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IndexError Traceback (most recent call last) in () ----> 1 print ( float_list [ 10 ] ) IndexError : list index out of range You can find the length of a list using the built-in function len : In [19]: print ( float_list ) len ( float_list ) [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0] Out[19]: 5 Indexing on lists plus Slicing And since Python is zero-indexed, the last element of float_list is In [20]: float_list [ len ( float_list ) - 1 ] Out[20]: 2.0 It is more idiomatic in Python to use -1 for the last element, -2 for the second last, and so on In [21]: float_list [ - 1 ] Out[21]: 2.0 We can use the : operator to access a subset of the list. This is called slicing. In [22]: print ( float_list [ 1 : 5 ]) print ( float_list [ 0 : 2 ]) [3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0] [1.0, 3.0] Below is a summary of list slicing operations: In [24]: lst = [ 'hi' , 7 , 'c' , 'cat' , 'hello' , 8 ] lst [: 2 ] Out[24]: ['hi', 7] You can slice \"backwards\" as well: In [25]: float_list [: - 2 ] # up to second last Out[25]: [1.0, 3.0, 5.0] In [26]: float_list [: 4 ] # up to but not including 5th element Out[26]: [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0] You can also slice with a stride: In [27]: float_list [: 4 : 2 ] # above but skipping every second element Out[27]: [1.0, 5.0] We can iterate through a list using a loop. Here's a for loop. In [28]: for ele in float_list : print ( ele ) 1.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 What if you wanted the index as well? Use the built-in python method enumerate , which can be used to create a list of tuples with each tuple of the form (index, value) . In [29]: for i , ele in enumerate ( float_list ): print ( i , ele ) (0, 1.0) (1, 3.0) (2, 5.0) (3, 4.0) (4, 2.0) Appending and deleting We can also append items to the end of the list using the + operator or with append . In [30]: float_list + [ . 333 ] Out[30]: [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.333] In [31]: float_list . append ( . 444 ) In [32]: print ( float_list ) len ( float_list ) [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.444] Out[32]: 6 Now, run the cell with float_list.append() a second time. Then run the subsequent cell. What happens? To remove an item from the list, use del. In [33]: del ( float_list [ 2 ]) print ( float_list ) [1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.444] You may also add an element (elem) in a specific position (index) in the list In [34]: elem = '3.14' index = 1 float_list . insert ( index , elem ) float_list Out[34]: [1.0, '3.14', 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 0.444] List Comprehensions Lists can be constructed in a compact way using a list comprehension . Here's a simple example. In [35]: squaredlist = [ i * i for i in int_list ] squaredlist Out[35]: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] And here's a more complicated one, requiring a conditional. In [36]: comp_list1 = [ 2 * i for i in squaredlist if i % 2 == 0 ] print ( comp_list1 ) [8, 32, 72, 128, 200] This is entirely equivalent to creating comp_list1 using a loop with a conditional, as below: In [37]: comp_list2 = [] for i in squaredlist : if i % 2 == 0 : comp_list2 . append ( 2 * i ) print ( comp_list2 ) [8, 32, 72, 128, 200] The list comprehension syntax [expression for item in list if conditional] is equivalent to the syntax for item in list: if conditional: expression Exercise 2: (do at home) Build a list that contains every prime number between 1 and 100, in two different ways: 2.1 Using for loops and conditional if statements. 2.2 (Stretch Goal) Using a list comprehension. You should be able to do this in one line of code. Hint: it might help to look up the function all() in the documentation. In [14]: primes = [] for i in range ( 1 , 101 ): if sum ([( i % p ) == 0 for p in primes ]) > 0 : continue if i != 1 : primes . append ( i ) primes Out[14]: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97] In [18]: [ i for i in range ( 2 , 101 ) if all ( i % j != 0 for j in range ( 2 , i ))] Out[18]: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97] In [ ]: # %load ../solutions/exercise2_1.py N = 100 ; # using loops and if statements primes = []; for j in range ( 2 , N ): count = 0 ; for i in range ( 2 , j ): if j % i == 0 : count = count + 1 ; if count == 0 : primes . append ( j ) print ( primes ) In [ ]: # %load ../solutions/exercise2_2.py primes_lc = [ j for j in range ( 2 , N ) if all ( j % i != 0 for i in range ( 2 , j ))] print ( primes ) print ( primes_lc ) Simple Functions A function object is a reusable block of code that does a specific task. Functions are commonplace in Python, either on their own or as they belong to other objects. To invoke a function func , you call it as func(arguments) . We've seen built-in Python functions and methods (details below). For example, len() and print() are built-in Python functions. And at the beginning, you called np.mean() to calculate the mean of three numbers, where mean() is a function in the numpy module and numpy was abbreviated as np . This syntax allows us to have multiple \"mean\" functions in different modules; calling this one as np.mean() guarantees that we will execute numpy's mean function, as opposed to a mean function from a different module. User-defined functions We'll now learn to write our own user-defined functions. Below is the syntax for defining a basic function with one input argument and one output. You can also define functions with no input or output arguments, or multiple input or output arguments. def name_of_function(arg): ... return(output) We can write functions with one input and one output argument. Here are two such functions. In [42]: def square ( x ): x_sqr = x * x return ( x_sqr ) def cube ( x ): x_cub = x * x * x return ( x_cub ) square ( 5 ), cube ( 5 ) Out[42]: (25, 125) What if you want to return two variables at a time? The usual way is to return a tuple: In [43]: def square_and_cube ( x ): x_cub = x * x * x x_sqr = x * x return ( x_sqr , x_cub ) square_and_cube ( 5 ) Out[43]: (25, 125) Lambda functions Often we quickly define mathematical functions with a one-line function called a lambda function. Lambda functions are great because they enable us to write functions without having to name them, ie, they're anonymous . No return statement is needed. In [44]: # create an anonymous function and assign it to the variable square square = lambda x : x * x print ( square ( 3 )) hypotenuse = lambda x , y : x * x + y * y ## Same as # def hypotenuse(x, y): # return(x*x + y*y) hypotenuse ( 3 , 4 ) 9 Out[44]: 25 Methods A function that belongs to an object is called a method . By \"object,\" we mean an \"instance\" of a class (e.g., list, integer, or floating point variable). For example, when we invoke append() on an existing list, append() is a method. In other words, a method is a function on a specific instance of a class (i.e., object ). In this example, our class is a list. float_list is an instance of a list (thus, an object), and the append() function is technically a method since it pertains to the specific instance float_list . In [45]: float_list = [ 1.0 , 2.09 , 4.0 , 2.0 , 0.444 ] print ( float_list ) float_list . append ( 56.7 ) float_list [1.0, 2.09, 4.0, 2.0, 0.444] Out[45]: [1.0, 2.09, 4.0, 2.0, 0.444, 56.7] Exercise 3: (do at home) generated a list of the prime numbers between 1 and 100 In Exercise 2, above, you wrote code that generated a list of the prime numbers between 1 and 100. Now, write a function called isprime() that takes in a positive integer $N$, and determines whether or not it is prime. Return True if it's prime and return False if it isn't. Then, using a list comprehension and isprime() , create a list myprimes that contains all the prime numbers less than 100. In [19]: # your code here def isprime ( n ): return all ([ n % i != 0 for i in range ( 2 , n )]) In [26]: [ n for n in range ( 2 , 100 ) if isprime ( n )] Out[26]: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97] In [ ]: # %load ../solutions/exercise3.py def isprime ( N ): count = 0 ; if not isinstance ( N , int ): return False if N <= 1 : return False for i in range ( 2 , N ): if N % i == 0 : count = count + 1 ; if count == 0 : return ( True ) else : return ( False ) print ( isprime ( 3.0 ), isprime ( \"pavlos\" ), isprime ( 0 ), isprime ( - 1 ), isprime ( 1 ), isprime ( 2 ), isprime ( 93 ), isprime ( 97 )) myprimes = [ j for j in range ( 1 , 100 ) if isprime ( j )] print ( myprimes ) Introduction to Numpy Scientific Python code uses a fast array structure, called the numpy array. Those who have programmed in Matlab will find this very natural. For reference, the numpy documention can be found here . Let's make a numpy array: In [48]: my_array = np . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]) my_array Out[48]: array([1, 2, 3, 4]) In [49]: # works as it would with a standard list len ( my_array ) Out[49]: 4 The shape array of an array is very useful (we'll see more of it later when we talk about 2D arrays -- matrices -- and higher-dimensional arrays). In [50]: my_array . shape Out[50]: (4,) Numpy arrays are typed . This means that by default, all the elements will be assumed to be of the same type (e.g., integer, float, String). In [51]: my_array . dtype Out[51]: dtype('int64') Numpy arrays have similar functionality as lists! Below, we compute the length, slice the array, and iterate through it (one could identically perform the same with a list). In [52]: print ( len ( my_array )) print ( my_array [ 2 : 4 ]) for ele in my_array : print ( ele ) 4 [3 4] 1 2 3 4 There are two ways to manipulate numpy arrays a) by using the numpy module's methods (e.g., np.mean() ) or b) by applying the function np.mean() with the numpy array as an argument. In [53]: print ( my_array . mean ()) print ( np . mean ( my_array )) 2.5 2.5 A constructor is a general programming term that refers to the mechanism for creating a new object (e.g., list, array, String). There are many other efficient ways to construct numpy arrays. Here are some commonly used numpy array constructors. Read more details in the numpy documentation. In [54]: np . ones ( 10 ) # generates 10 floating point ones Out[54]: array([ 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]) Numpy gains a lot of its efficiency from being typed. That is, all elements in the array have the same type, such as integer or floating point. The default type, as can be seen above, is a float. (Each float uses either 32 or 64 bits of memory, depending on if the code is running a 32-bit or 64-bit machine, respectively). In [55]: np . dtype ( float ) . itemsize # in bytes (remember, 1 byte = 8 bits) Out[55]: 8 In [56]: np . ones ( 10 , dtype = 'int' ) # generates 10 integer ones Out[56]: array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) In [57]: np . zeros ( 10 ) Out[57]: array([ 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]) Often, you will want random numbers. Use the random constructor! In [58]: np . random . random ( 10 ) # uniform from [0,1] Out[58]: array([ 0.85115672, 0.37346821, 0.3298871 , 0.47496563, 0.69940192, 0.97207796, 0.91488615, 0.36063927, 0.81240722, 0.16128617]) You can generate random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1: In [59]: normal_array = np . random . randn ( 1000 ) print ( \"The sample mean and standard devation are %f and %f , respectively.\" % ( np . mean ( normal_array ), np . std ( normal_array ))) The sample mean and standard devation are 0.025195 and 1.026880, respectively. In [60]: len ( normal_array ) Out[60]: 1000 You can sample with and without replacement from an array. Let's first construct a list with evenly-spaced values: In [61]: grid = np . arange ( 0. , 1.01 , 0.1 ) grid Out[61]: array([ 0. , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. ]) Without replacement In [62]: np . random . choice ( grid , 5 , replace = False ) Out[62]: array([ 0.3, 0.8, 0.7, 1. , 0. ]) In [63]: np . random . choice ( grid , 20 , replace = False ) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) in () ----> 1 np . random . choice ( grid , 20 , replace = False ) mtrand.pyx in mtrand.RandomState.choice () ValueError : Cannot take a larger sample than population when 'replace=False' With replacement: In [64]: np . random . choice ( grid , 20 , replace = True ) Out[64]: array([ 0. , 1. , 0.3, 1. , 0. , 0.9, 1. , 0.7, 0.2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6, 0.1, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, 0.3, 0.8, 1. ]) Tensors We can think of tensors as a name to include multidimensional arrays of numerical values. While tensors first emerged in the 20th century, they have since been applied to numerous other disciplines, including machine learning. In this class you will only be using scalars , vectors , and 2D arrays , so you do not need to worry about the name 'tensor'. We will use the following naming conventions: scalar = just a number = rank 0 tensor ($a$ ∈ $F$,) vector = 1D array = rank 1 tensor ( $x = (\\;x_1,...,x_i\\;)⊤$ ∈ $F&#94;n$ ) matrix = 2D array = rank 2 tensor ( $\\textbf{X} = [a_{ij}] ∈ F&#94;{m×n}$ ) 3D array = rank 3 tensor ( $\\mathscr{X} =[t_{i,j,k}]∈F&#94;{m×n×l}$ ) $\\mathscr{N}$D array = rank $\\mathscr{N}$ tensor ( $\\mathscr{T} =[t_{i1},...,t_{i\\mathscr{N}}]∈F&#94;{n_1×...×n_\\mathscr{N}}$ ) Slicing a 2D array source:oreilly In [ ]: # how do we get just the second row of the above array? Numpy supports vector operations What does this mean? It means that instead of adding two arrays, element by element, you can just say: add the two arrays. In [ ]: first = np . ones ( 5 ) second = np . ones ( 5 ) first + second # adds in-place Note that this behavior is very different from python lists where concatenation happens. In [ ]: first_list = [ 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ] second_list = [ 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ] first_list + second_list # concatenation On some computer chips, this numpy addition actually happens in parallel and can yield significant increases in speed. But even on regular chips, the advantage of greater readability is important. Broadcasting Numpy supports a concept known as broadcasting , which dictates how arrays of different sizes are combined together. There are too many rules to list here, but importantly, multiplying an array by a number multiplies each element by the number. Adding a number adds the number to each element. In [ ]: first + 1 In [ ]: first * 5 This means that if you wanted the distribution $N(5, 7)$ you could do: In [ ]: normal_5_7 = 5 + 7 * normal_array np . mean ( normal_5_7 ), np . std ( normal_5_7 ) Multiplying two arrays multiplies them element-by-element In [ ]: ( first + 1 ) * ( first * 5 ) You might have wanted to compute the dot product instead: In [ ]: np . dot (( first + 1 ) , ( first * 5 )) Probabilitiy Distributions from scipy.stats and statsmodels Two useful statistics libraries in python are scipy and statsmodels . For example to load the z_test: In [ ]: import statsmodels from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest In [ ]: x = np . array ([ 74 , 100 ]) n = np . array ([ 152 , 266 ]) zstat , pvalue = statsmodels . stats . proportion . proportions_ztest ( x , n ) print ( \"Two-sided z-test for proportions: \\n \" , \"z =\" , zstat , \", pvalue =\" , pvalue ) In [ ]: #The `%matplotlib inline` ensures that plots are rendered inline in the browser. % matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Let's get the normal distribution namespace from scipy.stats . See here for Documentation . In [ ]: from scipy.stats import norm Let's create 1,000 points between -10 and 10 In [ ]: x = np . linspace ( - 10 , 10 , 1000 ) # linspace() returns evenly-spaced numbers over a specified interval x [ 0 : 10 ], x [ - 10 :] Let's get the pdf of a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and standard deviation 3, and plot it using the grid points computed before: In [ ]: pdf_x = norm . pdf ( x , 1 , 3 ) plt . plot ( x , pdf_x ); And you can get random variables using the rvs function. Referencies A useful book by Jake Vanderplas: PythonDataScienceHandbook . You may also benefit from using Chris Albon's web site as a reference. It contains lots of useful information. Dictionaries A dictionary is another data structure (aka storage container) -- arguably the most powerful. Like a list, a dictionary is a sequence of items. Unlike a list, a dictionary is unordered and its items are accessed with keys and not integer positions. Dictionaries are the closest data structure we have to a database. Let's make a dictionary with a few Harvard courses and their corresponding enrollment numbers. In [ ]: enroll2017_dict = { 'CS50' : 692 , 'CS109A / Stat 121A / AC 209A' : 352 , 'Econ1011a' : 95 , 'AM21a' : 153 , 'Stat110' : 485 } enroll2017_dict One can obtain the value corresponding to a key via: In [ ]: enroll2017_dict [ 'CS50' ] If you try to access a key that isn't present, your code will yield an error: In [ ]: enroll2017_dict [ 'CS630' ] Alternatively, the .get() function allows one to gracefully handle these situations by providing a default value if the key isn't found: In [ ]: enroll2017_dict . get ( 'CS630' , 5 ) Note, this does not store a new value for the key; it only provides a value to return if the key isn't found. In [ ]: enroll2017_dict [ 'CS630' ] In [ ]: enroll2017_dict . get ( 'C730' , None ) All sorts of iterations are supported: In [ ]: enroll2017_dict . values () In [ ]: enroll2017_dict . items () We can iterate over the tuples obtained above: In [ ]: for key , value in enroll2017_dict . items (): print ( \" %s : %d \" % ( key , value )) Simply iterating over a dictionary gives us the keys. This is useful when we want to do something with each item: In [ ]: second_dict = {} for key in enroll2017_dict : second_dict [ key ] = enroll2017_dict [ key ] second_dict The above is an actual copy of _enroll2017 dict's allocated memory, unlike, second_dict = enroll2017_dict which would have made both variables label the same memory location. In the previous dictionary example, the keys were strings corresponding to course names. Keys don't have to be strings, though; they can be other immutable data type such as numbers or tuples (not lists, as lists are mutable). Dictionary comprehension: \"Do not try this at home\" You can construct dictionaries using a dictionary comprehension , which is similar to a list comprehension. Notice the brackets {} and the use of zip (see next cell for more on zip ) In [ ]: float_list = [ 1. , 3. , 5. , 4. , 2. ] int_list = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] my_dict = { k : v for ( k , v ) in zip ( int_list , float_list )} my_dict Creating tuples with zip zip is a Python built-in function that returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. This is an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. The set() built-in function returns a set object, optionally with elements taken from another iterable. By using set() you can make zip printable.

This course is the first half of a one‐year course to data science. We will focus on the analysis of data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Topics include data scraping, data management, data visualization, regression and classification methods, and deep neural networks (a detailed schedule will be made available soon). You will get ample practice through weekly homework assignments. The class material integrates the five key facets of an investigation using data: 1. data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set 2. data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably 3. exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition 4. prediction or statistical learning 5. communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit. Announcement: HW0 is now available.
