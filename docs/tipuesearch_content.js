Individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner. You are allowed to use OHs to ask questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with all of your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation. Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student? Yes. All CS109A students have access to all video captured materials. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID. Can I access live streaming? Only Harvard Extension School students have access to live-streaming of CS109A lectures, labs, and sections. However, our Friday Standard Section will be live-streamed to all the students that wish to participate in the Helix classroom, so you can attend in person or live online. Can I make-up quizzes? No. Only 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade. Auditors Can I audit this course? What can I and cannot do? Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture, sections and lab. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects, and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed. Extension School I am an Extension School Student, can I take the quizzes? And do they count towards my grade? All CS109A students have access to quizzes. If you are a Harvard Extension School student, the quizzes will not be considered towards your final grade. I am an Extension School student, can I attend lectures and OH in person? Yes, as a student from a Harvard School you are welcome to attend all learning instances (lecture, OH, Sections, and Labs) in person. Given the distance nature of the student body of Harvard Extension School, we also provide live streaming and video capture of our learning instances.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/faq.html"},{"title":"Homework Policies & Submission Instructions","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } V. September 16, 2019 General Policies Colaboration Except for HW4 and HW7 which will be done by each student individually , you're allowed and encouraged to work with a fellow student on the homework. This does not mean that you are to divide and conquer. In the spirit of learning and getting the most out of this course and out of collaborating with your peer, you should solve each problem on your own, compare with your partner, and decide on a common solution. Importing Libraries As much as possible, try and stick to the hints and functions we import at the top of the homework, as those are the ideas and tools the class supports and is aiming to teach. And if a problem specifies a particular library you're required to use that library, and possibly others from the import list. You are allowed to use other libraries such as seaborn. Late Submissions will not be accepted Extensions are provided only for medical reasons with a doctor's note. If there are issues, send an email to the Helpline . Submitting HW Homework assignments will be done in Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. When you are finished editing your notebook, re-run all the cells to make sure they work . Normally, you need only submit the .ipynb file with one caveat: If your notebook references other files such as images which are necessary for interpreting your work, they must be uploaded as well. You may also choose to \"attach\" the images to the notebook itself. See the section on markdown attachments under \"other additions\" here for details. File Naming Convention Name your file as follows: cs109a_hw#_?09_submit.ipynb (replace the # with the number of the assignment and replace ? with 1 or 2 depending if you are submitting the 109 or 209 hw). Do not include your name in the paper or the filename as we are doing anonymous grading. Making a HW Group in Canvas DO NOT make new groups. Look for an empty group among the pre-made groups for each assignment and join it. Follow instructions below. Click \"People\" in the navbar Click the \"Groups\" tab Type in the search box: \"HW#\" (replace # with the homework number, e.g. HW3) then wait a long time for the groups to load Choose an empty group and have both members in your pair click \"Join\". Again, this must be done before you submit and before the homework deadline. If you haven't joined a group before the homework deadline, we will assume you are working alone. Groups do not persist across assignments. You need to make a group for every assignment. Warning: If you are submitting in a pair: both members must join a Canvas group BEFORE they submit and BEFORE the homework deadline, whichever is earlier. If your group is not in place when you submit or if you submit after the assignment deadline, then you are submitting alone. This is a Canvas limitation.

This course is the first half of a one‐year introduction to data science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. The material of the course is divided into 3 modules. Each module will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: 1. data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; 2. data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably; 3. exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; 4. prediction or statistical learning; and 5. communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit. Course Logistics Prerequisites You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended). HW0 is designed to test your knowledge on the prerequisites. Successful completion of this assignment will show that this course is suitable for you. HW0 will not be graded but you are required to submit. Course Components Lectures The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Mon and Wed 1:30pm ‐ 2:45 pm in Northwest Building (NW), Lecture Hall B-103. Attendance to lectures is mandatory for FAS students. We will have in class quizzes to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Labs Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities. The instructor will go over practice problems similar to the homework problems and review difficult material. Attendance to labs is optional but strongly encouraged . Lab sessions are held Thur 4:30-5:45 pm in Pierce 301 . Sections Lectures and labs are supplemented by 1 hour sections led by teaching fellows. There are two types of sections: a) Standard Sections : which will be a mix of review of material and practice problems similar to the HW Standard Sections are held Fri 10:30-11:45 am at 1 Story St. Room 306 and Mon 4:30-5:45 pm in Science Center 110 Note: Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. The material covered on Friday and Monday is identical. b) Advanced Sections which will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the Advanced Sections is required for all AC 209A students. Advanced Sections are held Weds 4:30-5:45 pm at Maxwell Dworkin G115 Note: Advanced Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. Video Recordings All learning instances—lectures, labs, and sections—will be recorded. DCE students can stream these events in real time with a TF monitoring the accompanying chat room. Recordings will then be made available to all students within 24 hours via Canvas. Instructor Office Hours Pavlos & Kevin : Monday 3-5pm, IACS lobby Chris : Wednesday 3-4pm, Maxwell-Dworkin B125 Assignments There will be an initial self-assessment homework called HW0 and 8 more graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due in a week (1, 2, 5, 8) and some of them in two weeks (3, 4, 6, 7). You have the option to work and submit in pairs for all the assignments except HW4 and HW7 which you will do individually. You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own environment or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud. Instructions for Setting up Your Environment Instructions for Using JupyterHub On weeks with new assignments they will be released by Wednesday 3 pm. Standard assignments are graded out of 5 points. AC209a students will have additional homework content for most assignments worth 1 point. Quizzes Quizzes will be taken at the end of class and the material will be based on what was discussed in lecture; there will be no AC209a content in the quizzes. DCE students' quizzes will not count toward their final grade. 50% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. Final Project There will be a final group project (2-4 students) due during Exams period. See Calendar for specific dates. Participation Students as expected to be actively engaged with the course. This includes: attending lectures making use of resources such as office hours, labs, and sections participating in the Ed discussion forum — both through asking thoughtful questions and by answering the questions of others DCE students will not be penalized for the inability to attend lectures, labs, etc. live. Recommended Textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani.

Course Policies Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, JupyterHub, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: 1. Post the question in Ed and hopefully your peers will answer. Note that in Ed questions are visible to everyone. The TFs monitor the posts. 2. Go to Office Hours , this is the best way to get help. 3. For private matters send an email to the Helpline: cs109a2019@gmail.com . The Helpline is monitored by TFs. 4. For personal and confidential matters send an email to the instructors . Grading Guidelines and Regrading Policy Homework will be graded based on: 1. How correct your code is (the Notebook cells should run, we are not troubleshooting code) 2. How you have interpreted the results — we want text not just code. It should be a report. 3. How well you present the results. The scale is 1-5. For more details, check out The CS109A Grade . Questions on Graded Homework and Regrading Policy We take great care in making sure all homework assignments are graded properly. However, if you find that your assignment has grading oversights/errors you may: Contact the grader by emailing the helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" within 48 hours of the grade release (the grader's name can be found at the end of your notebook). If still unsatisfied with first regrading outcome, you may submit a reason via email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Second request\" within 2 days of receiving the initial regarding response. NOTE: once regrading is done, you may receive a grade that could be lower than the initial grade. Collaboration Policy We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students (and on Piazza), but you are not allowed to look at any other student's assignment or code outside of your pair. Discussion is encouraged; copying is not allowed. Please refer to the Academic Honesty section in The CS109A Grade . Late Day Policy Homework is due on Wednesdays. There are no late days. Late submissions will not be accepted. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Canvas . All homework and quizzes will be posted and submitted through Canvas, as well as all feedback forms. NOTE: make sure you adjust your account settings so you can receive emails from Canvas. Submitting an assignment Please consult Homework Policies & Submission Instructions Course Grade Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Non-Extension Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Homework0 1% Paired Homework (6) 39% Individual Homework (2) 17 % Quizzes 10% Project 30% Participation 3% Total 100% Extension Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Homework0 1% Paired Homework (6) 43% Individual Homework (2) 19% Project 33% Participation 4% Total 100% Software We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, Python 3, and various python modules. You can access the notebook viewer either on your own machine by installing the Anaconda platform (Links to an external site) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: Made /w Code . We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.) As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates. Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets and allow submission in pairs for most problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Academic Honesty section in The CS109A Grade .","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 1: Linear Algebra and Hypothesis Testing","text":"Slides Advanced Section: Linear Algebra and Hypothesis Testing [pptx] Advanced Section: Linear Algebra and Hypothesis Testing [pdf]","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section1/"},{"title":"Lecture 5: Linear Regression","text":"Slides Lecture 5: Linear Regression [pptx] Lecture 5: Linear Regression [pdf]","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture5/"},{"title":"Lecture 4: Introduction to Regression","text":"Slides Lecture4: Introduction to Regression [pptx] Lecture 4: Introduction to Regression [pdf]","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture4/"},{"title":"S-Section 01: Introduction to Web Scraping","text":"Jupyter Notebooks S-Section 1: Introduction to Web Scraping","tags":"sections","url":"sections/section1/"},{"title":"Lab 2:","text":"Jupyter Notebooks Lab 2: Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup Lab 2: More Pandas (extra practice)","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab2/"},{"title":"Lecture 3: Pandas and Web Scraping","text":"Slides Lecture 3: Pandas and Web Scraping [pptx] Lecture 3: Pandas and Web Scraping [pdf] Lecture Notebook Lecture 3: Pandas Tutorial","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture3/"},{"title":"Lab 1: Python basics, YAML environments, Numpy","text":"Jupyter Notebooks Lab 1: Introduction to Python and its Libraries","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab-1/"},{"title":"Lecture 1: Introduction","text":"Slides Lecture 1: Introduction [pptx] Lecture 1: Introduction [pdf] Lecture Notebook Lecture 1: Data Science Demo","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture1/"},{"title":"Lecture 2: Data and Data Exploration","text":"Slides Lecture 2: Data [pptx] Lecture 2: Data [pdf] Lecture Notebook Lecture 2: Data Science Demo","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture2/"},{"title":"CS109a: Introduction to Data Science","text":"Fall 2019 Pavlos Protopapas , Kevin A.
